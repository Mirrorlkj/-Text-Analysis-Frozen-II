metacritic,"Frozen II is funny, exciting, sad, romantic, and silly. It has great songs and a hilarious recap of the first movie, and then it is all of that all over again.
                                    "
metacritic,"The side plots are the burst of energy the movie needs.
                                    "
metacritic,"With Frozen II, Disney has done the impossible: It’s made a terrific animated-musical sequel.
                                    "
metacritic,"While lacking the surprise and simplicity of the original “Frozen,” the sequel is still largely wonderful in its own right. It fearlessly transforms the original characters and even its own storytelling format, eschewing the familiar for something grander and more complex.
                                    "
metacritic,"No sequel is essential, but Frozen 2 makes the argument that, even in the fairy tale land of Disney, they can still be important.
                                    "
metacritic,"The more times I listen to Frozen II’s rousing anthem Into the Unknown, the more I’m convinced of its earworm quality. It’s as good (and maybe better) than the indelible Let It Go.
                                    "
metacritic,"What you get out of Frozen II over the original is Anna and Elsa’s stronger relationship. They are together throughout most of the film, and their sisterhood is strong, fun to watch, and remains the heart of the film. Frozen II is a worthy sequel, and you’ll be glad Disney got greedy and made it.
                                    "
metacritic,"Disney delivers an uneven but sensationally entertaining sequel to the Oscar winner that pulls out all the stops.
                                    "
metacritic,"If Frozen was about coming to terms with who you are, Frozen II is about transformation. Does it offer further evidence for those who saw ""Let It Go"" as Elsa’s covert coming-out anthem? Sadly not, though she remains an intriguingly elliptical canvas on which to project genuinely groundbreaking ideas about empowerment and identity. 
                                    "
metacritic,"The best things about the first film — the characters and music — once again sing in a frequently dazzling if narratively flawed sequel that’s better at being sensory than sense-making.
                                    "
metacritic,"For all its feints and innovations, Frozen II knows its audience inside out, and wants to ensure every last subdivision leaves feeling both seen and satisfied. That’s obviously good business. But it’s also generous, deeply charming filmmaking.
                                    "
metacritic,"Because the first movie generated such a bracing gust of enthusiasm, Frozen 2 will inevitably be nitpicked and judged against those lofty standards. Still, there's plenty to enjoy for those willing to chill out, and yes, let the past go.
                                    "
metacritic,"Directors Jennifer Lee (who also wrote the screenplay) and Chris Buck, along with the obligatory army of talented Disney animators, deliver one brilliantly rendered set piece after another.
                                    "
metacritic,"At its best, and it’s mostly at its best, Frozen II has an air of enchantment.
                                    "
metacritic,"With so much going on, it’s easy to overlook that the most profound and moving relationship in either film is the bond between Elsa and Anna. It’s the most human and least-calculated thing in “Frozen” or Frozen II. Their love is the ultimate special effect. Ice is nice. But sisterhood is what’s really powerful.
                                    "
metacritic,"The movie itself occasionally gets lost in those woods, but finds its way back out again.
                                    "
metacritic,"Frozen 2 makes a valiant effort to live up to its predecessor, but can’t escape its shadow.
                                    "
metacritic,"There’s a lot to like here, from a rich palette of autumn colors to a potentially provocative subplot that will teach children that nations need to acknowledge and atone for their historical sins, but in the final tally, this is a sequel that exists not because there was more story to be told but because there was more money to be made.
                                    "
metacritic,"Frozen 2 has amazing animation and great new songs but also a muddied message and some continuity issues.
                                    "
metacritic,"An air of wistfulness imbues the proceedings, building to a resonant climax that’s hard to resist, despite some legitimate reservations about this uneven sequel.
                                    "
metacritic,"What’s smart about Frozen II is, instead of trying to just recapture its past glory, it decides to be interesting. And when making a sequel to a cultural phenomenon, “being interesting” seems both pretty rare and the best we can hope for.
                                    "
metacritic,"Like the first film, Frozen II is less a triumph of storytelling than of packaging. It bundles together a bunch of familiar, likable characters and a fresh list of bright, catchy songs, expertly written (by the returning duo of Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez) with an ear toward the Broadway showtunes they will one day inevitably become.
                                    "
metacritic,"In a world where old-timers accuse the youth of being oversensitive snowflakes, Frozen II shows what it means to have one’s heart in the right place.
                                    "
metacritic,"What is notable is how the film gives children a framework, and the language, to process this act of violence, same as it does the pain of grief, the bitter rub of mortality. I don’t know if that sensitivity will translate to a gajillion more princess dresses sold, but as a teaching aid for kids – a tool for taking on more adult concerns – I found it surprisingly impactful.
                                    "
metacritic,"Frozen II is just an echo, drawing prospective fans in without finding many new notes to hit.
                                    "
metacritic,"Directed by Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee (the latter also wrote the screenplay, both directed the original), it’s gorgeous-looking. It’s briskly paced. And it’s tuneful.  Uh, about those tunes: They’re blaringly, oppressively, crushingly LOUD! With “Frozen” we got the rousing Oscar-winning “Let It Go.” With Frozen II, someone should have told the songwriters to tone it down.
                                    "
metacritic,"It just doesn’t have the exciting, lightning-in-a-bottle feel that the wonderful original had. Perhaps that was too much to ask.
                                    "
metacritic,"If you were holding out hope that Frozen 2 could equal or surpass the original phenomenon, it’s time to let it go.
                                    "
metacritic,"The ensuing adventure is lively, amusing and predictably predictable with revelations, reconciliations and some nebulous politics for the grown-ups. It’s never surprising, yet its bursts of pictorial imagination — snowflakes that streak like shooting stars — keep you engaged, as do Elsa and Anna, who still aren’t waiting for life to happen.
                                    "
metacritic,"Frozen 2 is still a plenty enjoyable film, even if it lacks its predecessor’s subversive spark. But for me, watching generative and derivative nostalgia spar within it prompted a different sense of the familiar: bleakness about the future of mouse-eared entertainment.
                                    "
metacritic,"It adds up to a marginally more interesting experience than the first “Frozen,” but this sequel would have benefited from venturing a touch further into the unknown.
                                    "
metacritic,"Even with Frozen II’s problems, the ending affected me. Because some things do change. Even if they always remain Frozen.
                                    "
metacritic,"Frozen 2 has everything you would expect — catchy new songs, more time with easy-to-like characters, striking backdrops, cute little jokes, a voyage of discovery plot and female empowerment galore — except the unexpected.
                                    "
metacritic,"A solid sequel that hits the right notes and entertains without ever being quite as satisfying or essential as the original.
                                    "
metacritic,"It’s nice to see these figures again, but I couldn’t help feeling that there is something a bit underpowered and contrived about the storyline in Frozen II: a matter of jeopardy synthetically created and artificially resolved, obstacles set in place and then surmounted, characters separated and reunited, bad stuff apparently happening and then unhappening.
                                    "
metacritic,"The result is a convoluted, sporadically sensical, occasionally trippy film that can’t quite find a purpose amid all the manic world-building.
                                    "
metacritic,"Still — and with the full knowledge of committing an atrocious pun — the whole thing left me cold, partly because there’s no actual villain and thus very little concrete drama.
                                    "
metacritic,"It’s easier to think about Frozen II as a product than as a film because a (sometimes stunning-looking) product is all that it feels like.
                                    "
metacritic,"I could watch the background environmental action here for hours. But then the second thought of my Frozen 2 experience hit: I really wish I was listening to Let it Go right now.
                                    "
metacritic,"The sequel to the 2013 animated blockbuster is much better than, say, “Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World.” But Frozen II is still a disappointing continuation of the story of Queen Elsa and Princess Anna of Arendelle.
                                    "
metacritic,"Woke Disney, trying to navigate a tricky representational path, steps all over itself throughout.
                                    "
metacritic,"Both the songs (once again written by two-time Oscar-winners Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez) and the relationships between the characters — strong points of the original film — register with less energy and originality this time around. 
                                    "
metacritic,"While I admire the movie’s attempt to more deeply mine the identities of sister-princesses Anna (sweet, non-magical) and Elsa (restless, can control snow and ice), its discoveries are rushed and are served up half-baked.
                                    "
metacritic,"Frozen 2 doesn’t have its forebear’s ungainliness; in many ways, it’s more efficiently engineered. But it’s also far less surprising, even taking into account that a sequel’s first task is to give people what they expect.
                                    "
metacritic,"It plays like an animated musical built around forgettable tunes and impressive animated effects that were cooked up before the script was decided on.
                                    "
rotten_tomatoes,"Anna ends up singing ""hello darkness, I'm ready to succumb"" and ""this grief has a gravity, it pulls me down."" Like much of the rest of the film, it's a bummer.
                                "
rotten_tomatoes,"While it's interesting to see a Disney sequel borrow parts of its plot from The Fifth Element, of all things, Frozen II ultimately doesn't go anywhere we don't expect it to. Let's hope that the inevitable Part III is willing to take a few more risks.
                                "
rotten_tomatoes,"There's so much affection for and investment in the original characters...people will be excited...but I just didn't get the magic. It's fine, but Frozen I was so much more than fine...
                                "
rotten_tomatoes,"[Some] sequences have a gleam and a rhythm to them that encapsulates Disney animation at its purest and most sinuous. The film itself doesn't hit that sweet spot that makes Pixar animations, for example, fun for adults as well as their children.
                                "
rotten_tomatoes,"This movie is so confusing that even talking about it is confusing.
                                "
rotten_tomatoes,"This is a well-considered, beautifully made - if not particularly brave or adventurous - sequel which carries both emotional heft and an intriguing mystery at its heart.
                                "
rotten_tomatoes,"Frozen II is an ambitious and challenging animated film that tries to evolve not only its own story but also the expectations for all of Disney animation.

rotten_tomatoes,"'Frozen 2' is one more Disney film this year that has taken on some huge social topics and masked them in a story that rivets audiences.
                                "
rotten_tomatoes,"Your kids will love it. But if you're like me and you love the original for its depth and how well thought out its thematic strengths were, you will find this one sorely lacking.
                                "
rotten_tomatoes,"The songs in Frozen 2 are memorable, welcoming and fresh and its fun to see the Arendelle gang all back together.
                                "
rotten_tomatoes,"An enjoyable film, though Elsa's lack of romantic plotline would be more admirable if all of her songs didn't make her sound like she was trying to come out of the closet.
                                "
rotten_tomatoes,"Even those who don't will be swept up in the propulsive narrative, the sumptuous beauty and the delight of characters who love each other no matter what.
                                "
rotten_tomatoes,"But it's the relationship between Elsa and Anna that gets the main focus, as it should, offering the sisters another chance to forge their own paths.

rotten_tomatoes,"Frozen II is infinitely less transcendent and it is also solemn, leaden and of a feathery magic. [Full Review in Spanish]

rotten_tomatoes,"So, not a disaster, but certainly not great either.

rotten_tomatoes,"The original was always going to be a hard act to follow, and although it doesn't quite reach the heights, this sequel should give fans, old and new, a lot of joy.
                                "
rotten_tomatoes,"With its message of female empowerment, and soundtrack full of earworms - once again written by the award-winning couple Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez - Frozen 2 sticks to its predecessor's winning formula.
                                "
rotten_tomatoes,"Frozen 2 just lets us know what is missing and, for a film that puts a lot of weight behind the idea of its characters moving on, this one clearly knows it is not yet ready to.

rotten_tomatoes,"Ultimately, Frozen II feels like a strong continuation of the popular Disney franchise. The movie reunites some of the best parts of the first film and still manages to develop and improve on the already highly tuned stylistic imagery.

imdb,"I really appreciate that Disney didn't just crank out Frozen 2 a year or two after the original. They took their time and made sure the sequel was worthy of the original's quality. Frozen 2 deepens the mythology of the series while also exploring Anna & Elsa's parentage even further than I expected. The songs are expectedly superb (except for a few unnecessary tracks in the middle act), the animation is glorious, and I was once again moved to teary eyes towards the ending. Perhaps it doesn't completely reach the heights of the first film (not many animated films do) but I can see myself going back and enjoying the sequel just as much as I did with the first in 2013. 'Into the Unknown' is an absolutely smash hit too. So there's that.9.0/10"
imdb,As a big fan of the first Frozen film I went into the sequel with high expectations and i'm pleased to say that my expectations were met. I was very happy with the majority of the songs especially 'Some Things Never Change' however I do marginally prefer the songs from the original especially 'Let it Go' which outperforms its Frozen 2 counterpart 'Into the Unknown'. The story is definitely bigger this time around and has a much clearer plot with plenty of comical moments that are perfectly balanced with more intense scenes. I believe that hardcore Frozen fans will be happy with the character development and relationships throughout especially that of Elsa and Anna which is now fully established and is both believable and heart warming. In terms of the animation Frozen 2 is practically perfect and the heavier reliance on magic allows for several breathtaking scenes. I also loved the call backs to the first film and personally had no problem with the ending unlike many reviews I have seen.My only small negative would be that the plot was somewhat predictable but that is a common theme among modern day animated Disney films. Overall I was very pleased and would rate Frozen 2 - 9 out of 10.
imdb,"I found the story to be quite engaging all throughout the movie, and the end in my opinion is fairly great. All the voice actors do amazing, especially Adel Dazeem as Elsa, who has an incredible singing voice.
I adore the first movie, and I still think that one is better, but this sequel doesn't disappoint either, and the animation by the way is just impeccable, as you would expect from a movie of this magnitude."
imdb,"My favorite line of the movie is ""You are the one, you have been waiting for, from Elsa's last song in the movie. I won't give away the context but it's beautiful and something that I think insecurity is something everyone struggles with. It's also something I think everyone has the ability to overcome. The question is, ""Do they want to?"""
imdb,"Boring. Good visuals but way too much singing. It was good when the singing stopped but that was rare.
My kids did not care for it either. Good rental movie"
imdb,"I went into Frozen II with mid-level expectations and found myself really enjoying the fun, beauty, and magic much more than I anticipated. Both adults and kids alike will be able to find things they can relate to in this movie that is often lighthearted, but touches on many heavy topics.The biggest downside I found was the weak writing (or editing) near the end of the film. A lot builds up to it, but then it seems to come to an end too simply and without much in-content explanation. I do not know if they cut scenes out for time or if the writers couldn't come up with a way to make the moments have a stronger impact. Granted, the simplification might be better for young children.Either way, I wouldn't say that made the movie any less great, I just believe it could have even been better. I expect movie goers to come away with awe and wonder, giggles, maybe a tune or two stuck in their head, and likely a few questions regarding the climax. Which for the most part can easily be explained through assumption."
imdb,"Saw the first one, 13 times at the cinema! Today I saw this for the 2nd time ... in IMAX. I really like it! Well I won't see it 13 times ... Not that crazy anymore lol Maybe 3-4 more times. LoL Loved the ""Let it go"" moment :D Not spoiling anything LoL No words just go and see it for yourself ... p.s. I'm old af and love animated movies!"
imdb,I never would have though the day would come for the sequel of a beloved movie. Its been too long for a sequel. And yet it worth every snow drops. The sequel truly surpass its predecessor although the first has more memorable songs then this which only for me about 4 to 5 songs that I like. Truly recommended for family and your loves ones to enjoy!
imdb,"Frozen II continues with the story of Anna(Kristen Bell), Elsa(Idina Menzel), Olaf(Josh Gad), Kristoff(Jonathan Groff) & Sven. When the kingdom of Arendelle is in danger, Anna, Elsa, Olaf, Kristoff & Sven, go on a quest to discover the origin of Elsa's powers, in order to save Arendelle.Frozen II is an excellent film. Directors Chris Buck & Jennifer Lee have given us a sequel, that has all the elements that made Frozen(2013), such a success. The animation is breathtaking. The 3D is great. The songs written by Kristen Anderson-Lopez & Robert Lopez are fantastic but, not as iconic as its predecessor's songs. Overall though, Frozen II doesn't match up to Frozen(2013). Its story is not strong enough to justify its existence. The voice cast is the highlight of the movie. They sing flawlessly. Kristen Bell is spectacular as Anna. Idina Menzel is outstanding as Elsa. Josh Gad is hysterical as Olaf. Jonathan Groff is brilliant as Kristoff. Sterling K. Brown, Evan Rachel Wood & Alfred Molina are awesome as Mattias, Iduna & Agnarr, respectively. Frozen II is worth a watch if you're a fan of Frozen(2013). Just keep your expectations low & you won't be disappointed."
imdb,"The story of this movie is great and really luv it.....especially Olaf...ooooh he is very funny and wonderful.....luv the story, the character, really amazing........"
imdb,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)As you should know by now, I enjoyed Frozen more than I expected. Therefore, I was genuinely excited about its six-year sequel. It's one of the few movies in 2019 to which I went in 99% blind. I didn't watch a single trailer, I barely saw any images or small clips, and I didn't know anything about where the story was going. So, with my expectations moderately high, how did it perform? Very, very well. I'm going to write it straight away: I enjoy this sequel more than the original. For one simple reason: it possesses a more emotionally complex narrative, one which I think the target audience (basically kids) won't even fully understand.It's really hard to create an animated flick with a story that works for both adults and children. The best of the best are the ones that are able to almost tell two different narratives: one simpler for kids with basic life lessons, and another for adults with more profound themes. Frozen II doesn't reach this last level, but its layered screenplay allows for an exploration of Elsa's powers that I genuinely didn't expect. However, there's an evident downside to the extreme focus on Elsa's journey... The other characters are put aside with irrelevant subplots that only stretch the runtime a bit too much, and unfortunately, reach a certain point where out-of-character actions occur.There's even a period of time where a particular character simply vanishes from the story because Jennifer Lee and Chris Buck couldn't figure out what to do with it during the last act. Despite the subplots not being impactful or not being able to further develop its characters, I can't deny some sequences are entertaining and funny as hell. Olaf is the absolute MVP of the film, and just like in the original, he doesn't exactly have an arc. Nevertheless, he has one of the most hilarious sequences of the year. I cried from so much laughter. His song and a couple of scenes where Josh Gad goes all out are some of the funniest of the whole movie.The voice cast is once again perfect. Anna, Kristoff, and Sven are sort of along for the ride, with the trio only doing something useful in the last 15-20 minutes. Elsa is the real star of the show. From the opening shot to the last, it's all about her, and her powers' origin. It might get too convoluted for kids, but despite a few minor missteps, it's an extremely well-developed screenplay. With a remarkable build-up and some truly amazing songs, Elsa goes through several action moments where she showcases all that her magic can do. And it's visually mind-blowing. Like in the first film, the animation quality is extraordinary.They really put 200% effort into Elsa's magic sequences. From her running against a tide of waves to fighting against the four elements (water, fire, earth, and air), there are imaginative and incredibly entertaining scenes, which give the movie a level of entertainment superior to its predecessor. Put this together with the wonderful, powerful score, and you get a pretty epic film, scale-wise. I mean, Into the Unknown is not going to reach Let It Go's level of worldwide craziness, but it's a phenomenal song. It's even better hearing it while watching the actual scene play out. Both this one and Show Yourself have a build-up worthy of sending chills down your spine.All Is Found is also a memorable lullaby that a lot of parents are going to sing for their kids. When I Am Older is Olaf's hilarious musical moment that left me laughing throughout its entire run. I love Frozen II's score, more than the original's. That's something I genuinely wasn't expecting at all. Looking back, I now think the first installment doesn't even have enough significant songs. This sequel has tons of songs that are either extremely important for the characters or funny parodies. All are very captivating, catchy, and emotionally resonant. My advice: please, don't listen to the soundtrack before watching the movie. Not only the titles and lyrics offer plot spoilers, but they ruin that ""first experience"" feeling. I got chills during a couple of them precisely because I watched besides only hearing them.All in all, Frozen II compensates the six-year wait with a follow-up worthy of standing up to its original, which in my opinion, surpasses it. With an emotionally complex narrative, Elsa's powers are explored and developed in a captivating, creative, fun, and entertaining way. Disney really put their best animators on this because the quality of animation has never been as visually impressive as this. It really feels like a magical film. Elsa's magic demonstration plus the powerful, chill-inducing original score are two aspects that together provide some truly epic moments. However, Olaf is the MVP with a lot more screentime than in the original, and with a couple of the most hilarious scenes of the year. It's a shame that the focus on Elsa's arc pushed every other character aside, making them feel useless and with no exciting or impactful subplot. Runtime feels a bit stretched due to their side adventures, and exposition is pretty heavy throughout the entire duration. In the end, it's still a contender for Best Animated Feature Film of 2019."
imdb,Outdoes the last Frozen by a ton and was a great movie.
imdb,"Disney Sequels are an interesting conundrum. Almost every single Disney Movie sequel was produced by a different film studio (DisneyToon Studios) who gave us some terrible direct to video Disney Sequels such as Return of Jafar, Little Mermaid 2, and Fox and the Hound II. As of now only 4 Disney films have been given sequels made by Walt Disney Animation (Rescuers Down Under, Winnie the Pooh, Ralph Breaks the Internet, and Frozen II) Each Sequel is without a doubt better than the direct to video films, but as of right now This is the best of that bunch. Frozen II has a script and story that is much better than the first and actually gives heart and depth to a lot of our characters. Kristen Bell and the Wickedly Talented Idina Menzel give astounding vocal performances, and Josh Gad even made me cry. Though only time will tell how the songs fair to the public, I believe Frozen II is a sequel that could've been much worse, (and probably should have been) but it goes above and beyond and I don't think anyone will be Letting Go anytime soon."
imdb,"The first movie was a big surprise, no one in Disney imagined the popularity it would have, the merchandise sold out days after the premier and the restocks took forever. This had to be what everybody was hoping for and in a way it is, I never expect the second or third movie to beat the first because it does so only a few times. That being said the movie had beautiful amazing graphics, a good plot (for a kids movie) that gives the first picture continuity, catchy songs and a few good cute jokes."
imdb,"I don't remember the first one being all that spectacular either. It just had the one hit song ""let it go"" and somehow the joint registered to a lot of people.
Personally not a fan of musicals and as far as the music goes in this I felt they were trying for another hit, but I definitely don't hear one. Could not stand any of the songs.
The only constant in the movie is the comedy genius that is Olaf. This snowman could have had his own feature (instead of the short he made a few years ago). The laughs were always on point, and his pure innocence makes him the most interesting character.
Frozen 2 has a story the world needs right now and I loved the ending, it was magical, but the built up to the end did not wow me as much as I was expecting.
It was an extra added bonus for me to see it in Imax. As far as the animation it was really cool"
imdb,"I still enjoyed it for many reasons, it's still Frozen first of all and I also enjoyed it for nostalgic reasons. I know it's not supposed to be like the first Frozen, the characters are getting older, but the age group that are watching them are not. For even me (a 15 year old) it was a little too complicated for a movie that isn't supposed to be . I liked the idea of bringing a bigger story than in the last one, but it was too complicated and dark for something you could enjoy. I get that the movie industry is changing, but they have to watch how they change the movies. Otherwise it was enjoyable, the songs were great as always, the evolution of the characters was a nice change. Besides the darker tone, I enjoyed it, for nostalgic reasons and because it was Frozen I give it and 8/10."
imdb,"I think that sequels especially this one have a lot to overcome, especially when the movie is beloved. Many of the reviews seem like they were written by people who are intent on hating the movie. My husband and I have 3 kids; an 11 yo girl; 8 yo boy and 2 yo girl. We all went and liked it. I thought it started slow with unmemorable songs and mostly content from the trailer. From the moment Elsa sings Into the Unknown and beyond it really picked up and was a solid movie. It pulled at heart strings and had funny moments and some good songs. On all accounts it delivered and the box office is proving that. I worried that it would be really boring and pointless like Frozen Fever but it managed to pull in relevant pieces of Frozen 1 to make a pretty solid film. Worth seeing. Don't expect to know the songs coming out of the theater immediately. But they are decent and will grow on you."
imdb,"This movie was very awesome that the first one. I like every at the beginning in the middle an at the end. I feel like the story should continue. Now Elsa is free so what new things is going to happen to her and new experience and what about Anna I didn't see any wedding. I have message for you all, go watch the movie in theaters and put positive ratings and like this movie. And make this movie the best animated ever. One last question who wants to see frozen 3. If you want to have frozen 3, you know what to do. Liked this movie and tell friends and family go to watch the movie. I need your help that this movie be the best just the first one.!!please!!"
imdb,"This ""Movie"" has stunning visuals and NOTHING else! The ""Story"" is boring and more like a torture. The songs are like a torture, too! Boring, unmemorable, no real melodies, only this annoying ""Daa Da Daa Daaaa"", which is some kind of brainwashing... really bad! The trailers promissed so much and the movie delivered nothing... Again: Great looking visuals can't save a movie. It's so poor what was shown after six(!) years. The short-movies were way better than ""Frozen II""! I suggest to take the ""Frozen""-Bluray or DVD and watch it again. Then you will have a good time! By the way: My rating of 3/10 is for the visuals ONLY!"
imdb,Absolutely beautifully done! Every scene is so beautiful. The storyline is interesting. The music is great. Didn't disappoint at all.
imdb,"Are simply tone deaf and completely missing the point. You are adults ripping apart a movie that is made for kids, and if you had children you'd understand that it's not about your enjoyment, it's about theirs. And I had a wonderful time watching my daughter laugh and sing and laugh some more - thats the point. And Olaf has some hilarious quotes ""Samantha? I don't even know a Samantha!"" Lol now that's hilarious."
imdb,"It was just TONS of references to the first movie. It was ridiculous how many times they referenced something from the original movie. They literally explained the ENTIRE plot of the first movie once in the middle of the movie and partially in the after credits scene!! I get why they did it, and they did it for laughs, but dear God, it was excruciating.Every single character regressed from where we left them at the end of the first movie. From a story structure perspective they did the exact same story over again.The Lopez's did the best they could writing music for a truly mediocre story, but most of the songs felt like they phoned them in. ""Into the Unknown"" is musically an amazing song, and a phenomenal performance by Idina, but it will not have the sticking power of ""Let It Go."" It didn't evoke an emotional response because it didn't make any sense in the story. Tons of lines in the song make you think some things are going to happen, and then they never happen. It was very confusing.I was so excited to hear that Jonathan Groff would be singing something other than ""Reindeer's are Better than People"" (Which he sang again anyway because we have to reference the first movie ONCE MORE!) but his song ""Lost in the Wood"" was so bizarre and out of left-field story-wise it felt weird and uncomfortable.Josh Gad's performance was delightful, especially considering they wrote Olaf as an immature, irritating, annoyance in this movie. But, his song, which is so unrememberable it's not even worth looking up the title of, was a snorefest.The whole movie felt like they got a group of 11-year-old kids together and asked them what their favorite parts of ""Frozen"" were and then said, ""As long as we include all of those things, we'll have a hit!"""
imdb,We loved it. The story was fun and it was magical. Better than the first
imdb,"Frozen I had such an amazing story arc. Characters were introduced and developed well, jokes were well placed, and the music really enhanced the movie. The movie built up to such a wonderful and touching ending which was a fresh take on typical Disney films. The same cannot be said for Frozen II. The most glaring flaw is the music. A new song is introduced almost every 15 minutes that is not only not melodic, but doesn't serve any real purpose. The jokes are horribly placed and arbitrary. Characters change moods every half hour (one minute they're happy, next their fighting, then they love each other again). Finally the ending was terribly anticlimactic. It ends abruptly and in way that makes you go ""that's it?"" As it was with The Lion King, Disney has spent all their budget on visual effects and not enough on story. A huge disappointment."
imdb,"Probably nothing will beat Let it go, but soundtrack is still amazing and Elsas song is also great. Interesting touching story and surprising turn. Only I don't like as much Elsa's new look"
